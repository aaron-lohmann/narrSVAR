\title{Setup up of traditional sign restrictions.}
\usage{
tradsign_setup(
  data = NULL,
  shock_names = NULL,
  restr_matrix = NULL,
  hor_matrix = NULL,
  cum = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Orignal data used for estimating the model.}

\item{shock_names}{A vector of shock names on which traditional sign restric
tions should be imposed.}

\item{restr_matrix}{A matrix of dimenstions (length of shocknames)x(number o
f system variables) which capture the sign restrictions. Suppose a system
with one shock and 4 variables. Variable 1 and 3 are restricted to positive
signs, variable 2 is restricted to negative sign and variable 4 is
unrestricted. The defined matrix would be matrix(c(1,-2,3,NA))}

\item{hor_matrix}{A matrix which defines the hoirzons for which the restrict
ions are supposed to hold. This matrix has dimensions (length of shock names)
x2. Where the first column refers to the starting horizon and the second
column refers to the end horizon. Note, for convenience time period zero
and 1 are both treated as "on-impact".}

\item{cum}{A vector of length K indicating which variables should be treated
as cumulative.}
}
\value{
A list which contains restrictions hoirzons and shock names
}
\description{
tradsign_setup is used to define the inputs for narrsign() defining the trad
itional sign restrictions.
