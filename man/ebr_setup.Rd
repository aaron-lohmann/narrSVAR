\title{Define the elasticity bound restrictions.}
\usage{
ebr_setup(
  shock_names = NULL,
  num_variable = NULL,
  denom_variable = NULL,
  horizon = NULL,
  bounds = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{shock_names}{A vector of shock names on which elasticity bounds are
placed. Note, each shock can be mentioned multiple times.}

\item{num_variable}{A vector of variable indicators which are in the numerator.
Must have the same length as shock_names. Order of reference is in order of shock_names.}

\item{denom_variable}{A vector of variable indicators which are in the denominator
Must have the same length as shock_names. Order of reference is in order of shock_names.}

\item{horizon}{A vector of horizons for which elasticity bound restrictions
should hold. This should have the same length as shock_names.}

\item{bounds}{A vector of numerics which specify the elasticity bounds. This
should have the same length as shock_names.}
}
\value{
A list which contains the elasticity bound restrictions.
}
\description{
ebr_setup is used to define the elasticity restrictions to be applied. Note,
that these elasticities are computed as fractions.
